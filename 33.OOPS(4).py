""" 1. Cleaner Syntax:
With @property, you can access the method like an attribute, which makes the code more intuitive and readable.
 For example, s1.percentage feels more like accessing a property than calling a method, enhancing the clarity of the code.
2. Encapsulation:
Properties allow you to hide the implementation details. 
You can change how the percentage is calculated or add additional logic later without changing the interface.
 Users of your class can still access s1.percentage without needing to know if itâ€™s a method or computed property.
3. Read-Only Attributes:
By using @property, you can create read-only attributes easily.
 This means you can expose a value without allowing it to be modified directly, ensuring better control over how the data is accessed.
4. Dynamic Calculations:
If the value needs to be recalculated based on other attributes, using a property ensures it's always 
up to date without needing to remember to call a method after changing values. """
##Now an important concept-
##Getter method AKA Property method-
# The @property decorator in Python serves as a getter method, allowing you to retrieve values from attributes in a clean and controlled way.
# What is a Getter Method?
# A getter method is a method that allows you to access the value of an object's attribute.
#  It provides a way to retrieve the value while potentially adding some logic or computation when accessing that value.

# Using @property as a Getter
# Syntax: The @property decorator allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. 
# This means you can get the value without needing to call the method explicitly.
# An Example of Getter Method Using @property -
""" class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius  # Using a leading underscore to indicate it's a private attribute

    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self._radius ** 2  # Calculated property

# Creating an instance of Circle
circle = Circle(5)

# Accessing the area using the getter method
print(f"The area of the circle is: {circle.area}")   """# No parentheses needed

##Now Setter method-
# When you use the @property decorator for a getter,
#  you can also define a setter for the same property using the @<property_name>.setter syntax.
#  This allows you to control how an attribute is updated, including adding validation or transformation logic.

# Using Setters with @property
# Defining a Setter: To define a setter for a property,
#  you use the @<property_name>.setter decorator. This allows you to set the value of the property using an intuitive syntax.

# Encapsulation: Setters provide a way to encapsulate the logic for updating an attribute,
#  ensuring that any necessary checks or calculations are performed when the attribute's value is changed.
