Note 1 - Overview
We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines
against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. On the other hand, infection
rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including challenges
and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains, such as increased port congestion, intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor
supply. We have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to
administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments.
